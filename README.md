# CourseGrabber #
  CourseGrabber is an Android application which implements Android's
[Calendar Contract API]
(http://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/CalendarContract.html)
. University of Delaware students can use the app to download their schedule to their calendar app
from UD's UDSIS server.

# ToDo #
  Do the actual course grabbing within the app. For now, I do it from my laptop in a
separate Java program.
